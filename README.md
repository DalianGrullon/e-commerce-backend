## Description

E-commerce Backend is a server-side application and database that listens to various HTTP requests to perform `CRUD` operations in a `MySQL` database via the Sequelize `ORM`. 

In creating this project, I learned a lot about creating Models using the Sequelize ORM and using those models via routes to perform CRUD operations in a database. I also learned about complex associations, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

3. Once unzipped, ensure that MySQL is installed and hosting a live server

4. Open the `connection.js` file in the `config` directory and edit line 7 with your MySQL server information to ensure a proper connection. You can also create a `.env` file and include:

```
  DB_NAME = 'database name'
  DB_USER = 'Your username'
  DB_PASSWORD = 'Your password'
```

5. Run the `schema.sql` file in either DBeaver or via the command-line to initiate the database.

6. Run the following commands to  install all dependencies, seed the database, and start the application

```
npm install

npm run seed

npm start
```
